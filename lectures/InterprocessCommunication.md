# Interprocess Communication

## Imperative (RPC)
## Interrogatory (Request-Response)
- HTTP

## Declarative (Events)
- Introduction to Events
	- what is an event
	- event detection
	- event processing
    - event processing examples

## Coupling

- Static coupling
    - compile time
	- issue for development teams
	- microservices
- Dynamic coupling
    - run-time
	- interrogatory vs declarative semantics
- Scaling
    - Heavily coupled systems: complexity grows exponentially with size
	- Decoupled systems: complexity grows linearly
