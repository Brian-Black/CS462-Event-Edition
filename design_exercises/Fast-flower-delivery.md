# Design exercise: Fast flower delivery

## Scenario

The flower stores in a large city have established an agreement with local independent van drivers to deliver flowers from the city's flower stores to their destinations.

When a store gets a flower delivery order, it creates a request and broadcasts the request to qualified drivers within a certain distance from the store. The request includes the time for pick up (typically now) and the required delivery time for urgent deliveries.

A driver is then assigned and the customer is notified that a delivery has been scheduled.

The assigned driver picks up the delivery and delivers it, and then person receiving the flowers confirms the delivery time using an app on the driver's mobile device.

The system maintains a ranking of each individual driver based on his or her ability to deliver flowers on time.

Each store has a profile that can include a constraint on the ranking of its drivers, for example a store can require its driver to have a ranking greater than a certain value when they make the delivery request.

The profile also indicates whether the store wants the system to assign drivers automatically, or whether it wants to receive several bids and then make its own choice.

# Do This

For each of the following steps, use whatever documentation technique that you think will communicate your plans. Appoint one member of your group as the scribe and have that person record your architecture.

- Describe the use cases. That is, what are the roles that users of the system will have? What functionality is available to each of the roles? Which are the primary use cases.
- Describe the data model. What data needs to be stored and how is it structured?
- Describe the user interface for the primary use cases. You should produce a page flow diagram.
- What external APIs or services will you use?
- What internal API will you deliver?

***Note:*** You don't have to do these in the order I have here. You may want to do them some other way.

# Deliverables

Put the following on a single poster page for display:

- Describe the primary use cases.
- Diagram your data model
- Show the page flow for the primary use cases.
- List and briefly describe the business logic functions.

# Activity

The instructor will give this to you at the appropriate time.
