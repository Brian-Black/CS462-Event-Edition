# URI Exercise

_This exercise depends on each group having access to the Internet._

Complete the following in your supergroup. You will have 20-30 minutes.

1. Review the axioms in http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html and cool URIs in http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI
2. Go to Amazon.com. Observe the URLs as you click through the site. Critique the URL design.
3. Pick two other popular web sites. Critique their URL design. Here are some suggestions:
  - www.byu.edu
  - Blackboard
  - Salt Lake Tribune
  - CNN

## Some Questions

Consider these questions. Feel free to augment these with your own.

- Does site functionality use a GET or POST?
- Are the URLs readable? Is that good or bad?
- What would happen if Amazon regularly changed their URLs? Would their sales increase or decrease?
- Does Blackboard let you link to a quiz?
- How does Amazon's use of a GET for almost everything give them a "free ride" to some extent?
- How is Google related to good URI design?

## Report

Prepare a brief report of your findings. One member of your group will be called on to present it to the rest of the class.
