# Distributed Hash Tables and the Chord Algorithm

Conside the following picture (from *Distributed Systems* by Tanenbaum)

![Resolving key 26 from node 1 and key 12 from node 28 in the Chord system][fig54]

Answer the following questions:

0. Assume node 7 has just joined the network. Calculate the finger table for node 7. Would there be any changes to finger tables on other nodes? If so, calculate them.

1. Draw the chords of looking up key 12 from node 21 before and after the change in (1) above.

2. If we insert a node into a Chord system, so all of the affected finger tables need to be instantly updated?  justify your answer.
