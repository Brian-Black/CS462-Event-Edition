# CS462 Project for Evented Systems

This repository includes project notes and code for the CS 462 a class at Brigham Young University on large scale distributed systems. This edition of the class is taught by Phil Windley (<http://www.windley.com>) and focuses on using event-based architectures. 

This class uses _Event Processing in Action_ by Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett as the text.

If you learn nothing else in this class, you might at least learn to use Git. :)

# Late projects

Students are encouraged to meet project deadlines. I want to see all students complete every lab by the end of the semester. As an incentive to help you stay current, we will keep track of the number of days each project component is turned in early or late (weekends and university holidays excluded). There is a maximum of five days early or late for any given project component  We will keep a running balance of your project early days. A positive balance indicates that you are ahead. A negative balance indicates that you are behind overall. 

At the end of the semester, you will receive a penalty if your balance is negative: 2% for each late day on your final balance. If all projects are completed, the penalty for late days will be capped at 20% so that your grade is reduced by a maximum of one letter grade.
