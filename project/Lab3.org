* Lab 3: Consuming and Processing Events

* Delivery Driver

- Build an event consumer to listen for and process Foursquare "events"
- Store information about the last checkin locally
- Create multiple, unique Event Signal URLs (ESLs) for each flower shop the drive wants to deliver for
- respond to _bid_needed_ events by
  - automatically responding if the driver is within N miles of the flower shop and sending the driver a SMS notification of the flowershop to go to and details of the bid
  - sending the driver and SMS if the bid can't be processed automatically. If the driver responds to the SMS with the keyword "bid anyway" the system submits a bid.
- Bids are submitted by sending a _bid_available_ event to the flowershop's ESL.
  - When a driver registers with the flowershop, the flowershop should give each driver an ESL to use.
  - The driver puts the Flowershop ESL in their delivery system in such a way that it is associated with the ELS the driver gave the flower shop.
