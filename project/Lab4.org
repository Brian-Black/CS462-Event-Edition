* Lab 4: Event Intermediaries

Introduces intermediaries in the form of a driver's guild that represents drivers, keeps track of driver performance, and distributes _bid_needed_ events.

- Flowershop now just has the guild ESL and signals it. 
- Guild knows about all drivers
- Drivers send a _delivery_complete_ event when they're done with the delivery. The guild ranks drivers in terms of their on-time performance.
- _bid_needed_ events are distributed to the top three drivers automatically as well as any that are within N miles of the shop.
