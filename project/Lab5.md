# Lab 5: Final Project

**Objective**: Work with a small group to build an event-driven solution to a problem of your choice according to the parameters described below.

## Constraints

- Your group must have at least two and not more than three people
- You must use at least two APIs listed at (http://programmableweb.com)
- Your architecture must be primarily event-driven
- You must get your project idea approved by the TAs and Dr. Windley before you begin

## Accommodations

- You may use any programming language(s), frameworks, or libraries that you choose
- You may build the system anywhere you like

## Proposal

You are required to submit a written proposal (around half a page) to the TAs that includes the following information:

- What the system will do
- A high-level description of your event architecture
- A list of the APIs you will use
- Who is in your group

## Deliverables

You will present your project to class during the final 2-3 class periods. You presentation should include at least:

- Statement of the problem you were solving
- List of component APIs and why you chose them
- Description of event generators and consumers
- Description of the events
- Architectural diagram and explanation
- A demonstration of your system 
- Methods used in constructing your solution (language, libraries, servers, etc., and their configuration). 
- Analysis of why events were or were not a good solution to the problem you chose

You will also submit your code and a writeup describing the foregoing points. That is due on the last day of class and will be graded separately from your presentation.

Your group will have seven minutes to make your presentation including set-up.  

Ideally, you should use the class computer to access an online presentation of your project to cut down on setup time. Google presentation, Presi, Slideshare, or even just plain old Web pages will work.

## Grading

Grading for this lab in in three portions:

- **Proposal** (10%)
  - Pass or fail: Submit the written proposal by the deadline and have it approved
  - Architectural diagram and explanation 
- **Presentation** (35%)
  - Score will be determined by Dr. Windley and the TAs based on the quality of your presentation and demonstration
- **Final submission** (55%)
  - 7% &mdash; Statement of the problem
  - 12% &mdash; APIs you chose and why
  - 12% &mdash; Description of events, event generators, and event consumers
  - 10% &mdash; Architectural diagram and explanation
  - 8% &mdash; Analysis of why events were or were not a good solution
  - 6% &mdash; Completeness of your solution to problem 

## Submission

Please zip up your code and writeup together and submit that through Gradebook.
