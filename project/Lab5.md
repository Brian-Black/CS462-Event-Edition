# Lab 5: Final Project

**Objective**: Work with a small group to build an event-driven solution to a problem of your choice according to the parameters listed below.

## Constraints

- Your group must have at least two and not more than three people
- You must use at least two APIs listed at (http://programmableweb.com)
- Your architecture must be primarily event-driven
- You must get your project idea pre-approved by the TAs and then get final approval from Dr. Windley before you begin

## Accomodations

- You may use any programming language(s), frameworks, or libraries that you choose
- You may build the system anywhere you like

## Deliverables

You will present your project to class during the final 2-3 class periods. You presentation should include at least:

- Statement of the problem you were solving
- List of component APIs and why you chose them
- Description of event generators and consumers
- Description of the events
- Architectural diagram and explanation
- A demonstration of your system 
- Analysis of why events were or were not a good solution to the problem you chose

## Twilio

You're not required to use any particular technology for this project. However, a developer evangelist from Twilio will be visiting during one of the presentation days. If you use Twilio, we'll have you present your project on that day. The guy from Twilio will have prizes and swag for the best projects, and he'll write about them on Twilio's blog.

We encourage as many of you as are interested to build Twilio into your project and join the competition.
